# Deploy the Cosmos3 Certified NIM with Helm

A Cosmos3 Certified NIM Helm chart is not yet published. The chart repository,
version, values schema, resource names, and monitoring integration will be added
when they are available. This page describes the deployment requirements that
can be prepared in advance.

## Prerequisites

Prepare:

- a Kubernetes cluster with supported NVIDIA GPU nodes;
- NVIDIA GPU Operator or another supported device-plugin stack;
- `kubectl` and Helm access to the target namespace;
- a storage class suitable for the model cache;
- outbound NGC access or an approved pre-populated-cache workflow; and
- an `NGC_API_KEY` with NGC Catalog access.

Choose a model and hardware configuration from the
[Support matrix](support-matrix.md), then confirm that the selected image
contains that configuration before setting GPU resources.

## Inspect the released chart

No Cosmos3 Certified NIM Helm chart is published yet, so there is no runnable
chart-inspection command. When the chart is published, take its exact repository
and version from the release notes, pin both values, and inspect that version's
README and values schema before installation. Do not copy values from another
NIM or chart version.

## Create NGC secrets

The deployment needs one secret for the image pull and one for runtime artifact
download:

```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry ngc-image-pull \
  --docker-server=nvcr.io \
  --docker-username='$oauthtoken' \
  --docker-password="$NGC_API_KEY"

kubectl create secret generic cosmos3-ngc \
  --from-literal=NGC_API_KEY="$NGC_API_KEY"
```

The runtime secret key must be named `NGC_API_KEY`. In production, use the
cluster's approved secret manager or CI injection instead of commands that can
expose credentials through shell history or process inspection.

## Required chart concepts

Map the following concepts to names from the released chart schema:

- explicit image repository and tag;
- image-pull and runtime NGC secrets;
- `NIM_MODEL_TYPE`;
- `NIM_MODEL_VARIANT` for Generator or Reasoner;
- `NIM_PERF_PROFILE` for Generator;
- optional `NIM_PRECISION` pin;
- GPU and system-memory limits matching a released configuration, including
  any additional RAM required by model offload;
- a writable model cache mounted at `/opt/nim/.cache`;
- an adequately sized in-memory `/dev/shm` volume;
- service port `8000`, unless deliberately changed;
- liveness `/v1/health/live` and readiness `/v1/health/ready`;
- a startup budget for cold download, materialization, load, and warmup; and
- a security context that can write to the cache.

No conceptual values file is included until the released key names are known.

## Storage and scaling

A persistent cache avoids repeated downloads and materialization. Select a
pattern supported by the chart and storage system:

- one PVC per replica avoids concurrent writers but duplicates artifacts;
- a shared `ReadWriteMany` PVC can reduce downloads but needs validated locking,
  ownership, and throughput; and
- `hostPath` ties a workload to a node and adds security and scheduling risks.

Each replica must receive a complete GPU allocation compatible with its model.
Validate cold start, rolling updates, cache ownership, scale-up, and probe
budgets before production use.

## Install and verify

Use the install command, resource names, and port-forward instructions from the
released chart documentation. After rollout, require readiness before sending
traffic:

```bash
curl -f http://localhost:8000/v1/health/ready
```
